NOTES FOR POP-UP Sheehy

-HOME PAGE
-- I see there is a default which is like a splash page, then index which is a home page. How can we remove the splash page without going into the c# and adding a cookie session?

-PRODUCT PAGE
-- How to get rid of the left side nav?
-- How to style the radio buttons to look like the mock?
-- How to just add to cart, with the quantity always just being one?

Cart Page
-- how to change so quantity will only be one since they can only pick one product?
--

CHECKOUT PROCESS-- These are in their own folder called checkout. These also use a new master folder called checkout.master
Main things of concern asthetic wise. The breadecrumbs, and the checkout hero.

After Cart page
-- Instead of logging/register it will just be logging in with pre-made users.
(I know how to delete but I'm not sure it is the right thing to do.) on cart.ascx on user controls

--Purchase for page
-- Lets get rid of this and go right into shipping
(Was able to do this by going into cart.ascx and changing line 90 on the checkout button)
(however 1-6 option still exist so i need to look into where to delete that step....)

-Shipping page-
-- Looks like should only be just a name an address with no custom shipping methods.

Shipping Choice
-- Get rid of this page.

Reivew and Confirm
- No checkout options like CC or PO. just a review of the product.
